## Description

Many students struggle to feel as part of their school community and lack motivation towards learning. We believe the root cause is that they haven’t found their specific niche. The best solution for promoting a combination of theoretical knowledge, flexibility, teamwork, leadership, time management, and communication skills is interest-related education.

When it comes to interest groups and student clubs, several challenges arise:

- **Accessibility:** Limited options for extra-curricular activities, especially in small towns.
- **Finding Like-minded Individuals:** Difficulty in connecting with fellow thinkers.
- **Leadership Knowledge:** Lack of knowledge for leading a group of like-minded people.

Despite these challenges, many secondary school students want to join interest clubs, whether it's discussions, genealogy, cooking, or other passions.

### Solution: Biedri Web App

To address these challenges, we developed the Biedri Web App as part of our CS50x final project. This app aims to popularize the creation of like-minded clubs and provides solutions for the issues mentioned above.

### Key Features

- **User Registration:** Register using your email, full name, region, and school.
- **Club Creation:** Create a page for your club with details like category, description, goal, address, and location.
- **Club Discovery:** New users see recommended clubs and can easily join them.
- **Membership Management:** Club leaders can accept/refuse new applicants, view members' profiles, manage membership, and update the club's profile page.
- **Club Map:** View a map of all existing clubs to find those nearby.
- **Future Enhancements:** Group chat system, closed "social media" for club activities, smarter recommendation algorithm, and leadership tips.

### Navigation

The navbar allows for easy navigation throughout the web app. Clicking the Biedri logo directs you to the main page, which includes all clubs. The app is responsive to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on any device.

### Technologies Used

- **Database:** SQLite for storing user and club data.
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap for design elements and responsiveness.
- **Mapping:** Leaflet for displaying clubs on a map.
- **Hosting:** The app is hosted online at [kenryhraval.pythonanywhere.com](http://kenryhraval.pythonanywhere.com).
